# AsyncStorage Demo

`AsyncStorage` is [deprecated](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/asyncstorage) in React Native ðŸ˜± due to the [Lean Core Initiative](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/23313)

While it's completely okay to continue using the `AsyncStorage` from `expo`, because `expo` keeps their own fork for the `react-native`.

But if you want to use latest the greatest libraries ðŸ™ˆ, let's use `react-native-async-storage` on top of bare `react-native`

## ðŸš€ Script

```sh
# Make sure you have installed watchman from brew
watchman watch .

# finger crossed
react-native run-ios

```
